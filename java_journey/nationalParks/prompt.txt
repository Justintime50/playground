Open the Java project 1410_LABS and add a new package called textManipulation.
Add a class called LabTextManipulation that includes the main method.

Inside the main method, do the following:

- Create an ArrayList of strings and call it parks.
- Read in the names of national parks from the user until the user enters done (or DONE,
or dOnE, .. ) Keep in mind, that the names of some national parks consist of more than one word, for example, Mesa Verde.
- As you read in the national parks, add them to the list.
- Next, we are going to build a string based on the elements in the list parks. Since the text keeps changing as we add one park at a time, we use class StringBuilder for this task. 
- Use a StringBuilder called sb to create the string nationalParks.
- Loop through all the elements of the list parks and add them one at a time.

The resulting string should have the following format:
Favorite National Parks: {park1} | {park2} | . . . | {parkN}
The parks are separated by a space, a vertical bar, and another space. However, there is no vertical bar after the last element. {park1}, {park2}, {parkN} are the various list elements with updated spelling.
Create a private method to update the spelling.
We can't control whether the user enters the park names in uppercase or lowercase letters. However, we can change the names to a spelling where all letters are lowercase except for the first letters of each individual word. In order to make those changes, create a private method called updateSpelling. It has the following method header:
private static String updateSpelling(String text)
E.g.: When you pass the string "MESA VERDE" the method returns "Mesa Verde"
E.g.: When you pass  "yEllOwstOnE" it returns "Yellowstone"
E.g.: Passing "black canyon of the gunnison" returns "Black Canyon Of The Gunnison"
E.g.: Passing  "Denali" returns "Denali"
Hint: Class Character (Links to an external site.) includes a method toLowerCaseâ€‹ (Links to an external site.)
When you are done building the specified string in SringBuilder, print it.
 Sample Output
The output depends on the information provided by the user.
