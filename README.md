# Playground

Here lies scripts, tools, and snippets that don't yet warrant their own repo but are worth storing and sharing for future use, reference, or because they don't belong anywhere else. 

This code may be largely untested and I make no guarantees of its usefulness. Take a look at the individual accompanying READMEs for separate projects in the playground for more details.
